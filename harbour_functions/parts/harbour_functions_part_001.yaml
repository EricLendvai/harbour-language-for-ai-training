      This function is the "functionalized" counterpart of **`APPEND FROM`** command.
      In fact, the **`APPEND FROM`** command is transcribed as a call to this function via a **`#command`** found into [`/include/std.ch`](https://github.com/harbour/core/blob/edbafd4e1dad68784566dbbd48c9068ba772bf63/include/std.ch#L427)
      header file, which file is automatically included/preprocessed by the compiler on every compilation. It has the advantage that it can be used in expressions, where the command cannot.

      If all three parameters are specified, the function will return the value of the variable. In case of arrays and hash arrays, probably only a reference.

      Note that the presence of the 2nd argument (or at least the comma next to the 1st one, in which case `NIL` is implied as `xValue`) is mandatory, even if a specific xValue is not meant to be simultaneously added, otherwise RTE occurs; in such a case, the effect is identical to _`ASize(aArray, Len(aArray)+1)`_.

    description: |-
      Displays a [Pop-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_menu)-like menu with selectable menu items, waiting for a selection by user. Returns the index number of the selected item, which is the ordinal position of the item into the <acMenuItems> array; if the selection aborted, (when for example, the Esc key pressed) the value returned is `0` (zero).
      
      - `<acMenuItems>` is an array of character strings to display as the menu items.
      - **`<xSelect>`** is used to determine whether one or more menu items will be selectable or not! It can be either:
       - a parallel array of logical or character values, one element for each item in `<acMenuItems>`. If the element is a character string, it is evaluated as a *macro expression* which should evaluate to a logical data type.
       - or a single logical value, in which case all menu items will be either available when `.T.` or unavailable when `.F.`; default  is `.T.` (i.e., all items be available).
       - or codeblocks, function pointers or character expression, being supplied both 'as is' or 'as an array'. When passed as a single value and the next parameter `<xUserFunction>` is empty, it's being used as `<xUserFunction>` (surrogate), while all the items become selectable. *This is a new Harbour extension!*
      - `<xUserFunction>` is the name of a user-defined function or a function Symbol or a Code-block that executes when an unrecognizable key is pressed. Must be noted that the behavior of Achoice() is significantly affected by the presence or not of this argument. Refer to [Clipper Reference Guide](https://harbour.github.io/doc/clc53.html#achoice) for more...
      - `<nPos>` is the position in the `<acMenuItems>` array of the item that will be highlighted when the menu is initially displayed.
      - `<nHiLiteRow>` is the [zero-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering) number of the window row on which the initial menu item will appear.

      Evaluates the `<bBlock>` for each element into `<aArray>`, starting from `<nStart>` and  continues until `<nCount>` elements or all array elements have been evaluated (i.e. processed).
      The code-block receives two argument values:
      1) the current element being evaluated (value may be of whatever type)
      2) the numeric position (index) of that element into the array.
      Please note that in case the `<nCount>` exceeding the array elements the function does **not** issue any kind of *'out of range'* error (practically, it means that the number of evaluations may not necessarily be equal to `<nCount>`). This behavior stands also for other array functions.

    description: |-
      Create a database file (a dbf) from a database structure array.
      `<cFileName>` is the name of the database file to be created. If an extension is not specified, `.dbf` is assumed.
      `<aStruct>` is an array that contains the structure of database as a series of sub-arrays, one per field. Each sub-array contains the definition of each field's attributes and has the following structure:
      
      |Position| Metasymbol| Dbstruct.ch|
      |:------:|:----------|:-----------|
      | 1      | cName     | DBS_NAME   |

      | 3      | nLength   | DBS_LEN    |
      | 4      | nDecimals | DBS_DEC    |
      
       `<cRDD>` specifies the replaceable database driver (RDD) to use, specified as a character expression. If not specified `DBFNTX` is used.
      4-th argument `<lKeepOpen>` is Boolean flag indicating if file should stay open (any Boolean value will enable this behavior). 5-th is alias and if not given then the work area will stay open but **without** any alias, not even the filename of created database (this is a notably different behavior than what happens when `USE` command or `dbUseaArea()` function are invoked, where if no alias provided, by default, the name of database file is used as alias).
      **Note 1:** the dbCreate() function does **not** check for duplicate field names. It could perfectly create fields with the same name, without any warning, with all unpredictable consequences of such an action. Developer alone has the responsibility to not use the same field name twice.
      **Note 2:** If `<cRDD>` is different than default `DBFNTX`, it must have been explicitly requested and linked (using a *REQUEST* statement in source code), before can it be used.
      **Note 3:** Setting lKeepOpen to .f. is sometimes not respected. Instead specify .t., and an alias, than use dbCloseArea().

      Move to the record having the specified key value.
      
      - `<expKey>` is a value of any type that will be searched and specifies the key value (index key) associated with the desired record. If such a record is found, it becomes the current record and the function returns `.T.` (true); _in any other case_ it returns `.F.` (false).
           Searching is performed on logical records which are considered in indexed order. If a **filter** is set, only records which meet the filter condition are considered. If the work area has more than one active index, the operation uses the controlling order as set by `dbSetOrder()` or the `SET ORDER` command.
      
      - `<lSoftSeek>` is an optional logical value which specifies whether a "soft seek" is to be performed or not, and directly affects where the record pointer shall positioned, **in case the searched `<expKey>` value is not found.**
        - for a normal not soft seek (i.e. when `lSoftSeek==.F.`), the record pointer is positioned to `LastRec() + 1` and the `Eof()` returns `.T.` (true).
        - for a soft seek (i.e. when `lSoftSeek==.T.`), the record pointer is positioned **to the first record whose key value is greater than the specified key value**.  If no such a record exists, the record pointer is positioned to `LastRec() + 1` and the `Eof()` returns `.T.` (true), (in other words, result is same as normal (not soft) seek).
      If `<lSoftSeek>` is omitted, the **current** global `_SET_SOFTSEEK` setting is used.
      - `<lFindLast>` is an optional logical value that can specified as `.T.` (true) to seek the last occurrence of
           the specified key value.  The default is `.F.` (false), which means to seek the first occurrence. Note: This parameter may not supported in all RDDs.
